# GitHub Clash!
Some time ago I decided to start properly learning full stack web dev, and I wanted to start with front end and the loved REACT. Because of that I decided to take part on the course created by @tylermcginnis (really good one). As part of the course I had to create a project, in this case, a platform where two github users would be able to battle and see who was more popular on GitHub. 

# Here you have some screenshots of the webapp
